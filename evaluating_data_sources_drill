Evaluating Data Sources Drill

Example 1: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?

Answer: This is an example of data being collected under an exceptional circumstance. It's likely that a lot more properties are being rented than usual on Christmas Eve. The data would not be representative of neighborhood popularity throughout the year. 

The data should either be collected at another time of year or the research question could be reframed to look at what Amsterdam neighborhoods are popular on Christmas Eve.

Example 2: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities? 

Answer: Another example of data being collected under an exceptional circumstance. Given that the data was collected 1 day after a large-scale terror incident in New York City the data collected from that city will inevitably be skewed and not be representative of how the city generally uses mental health services. 

The data should either be collected during another time of year.

Example 3: Armenian Pub Survey. Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs? 

Answer: The data is biased towards young students. 

The research question could be adjusted to focus on young students' common reasons for visiting local pubs.
