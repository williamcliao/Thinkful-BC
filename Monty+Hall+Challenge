You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?


Switch. 

On your initial selection, you have a 1/3 probability of correctly identifying the prize. That leaves the probability of the prize being in the other two doors at 2/3.

When the host reveals evidence that that 1 of the 2 doors is a dud (this is where Bayes comes in), that effectively leaves the probability that the remaining door has 2/3 the probability of having the prize behind it. 

You should always switch as you will have double (2/3 vs. 1/3 if you don't switch) the probability of winning the prize.
